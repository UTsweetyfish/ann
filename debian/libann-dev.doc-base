Title: ANN Programming Manual
Author: David M. Mount
Abstract: ANN is a library written in the C++ programming language to
 support both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching in spaces of
 various dimensions. ANN (pronounced like the name "Ann") stands for the
 Approximate Nearest Neighbor library. ANN is also a testbed containing
 programs and procedures for generating data sets, collecting and analyzing
 statistics on the performance of nearest neighbor algorithms and data
 structures, and visualizing the geometric structure of these data
 structures.
 .
 This manual describes how to download and install ANN, how to use the
 library, how to change its configuration for different distance functions
 and data representations, and finally how to use its utility programs for
 testing and visualizing the data structure.
